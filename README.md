# Ideas

##Â Command-line Spotify player
* It will be able to search for songs, play any song/playlist/radio/podcast/etc., edit song playlists/favorites, play the song directly that is first on the search results, and many more stuff that you can easily do with spotify app

## Evolution Simulation(Evo-Sim)
* Creatures will evolve according to their DNA
* New gens that does new things will be able to easily added later.
* They will start as little round livings and they will change shape and features according to their gen(like growing in one direction, being able to send signals/harming rays/, having an ability to compute more, and many many more things)
* There will be config file that give the ability to change and tweak settings
* Different places of DNA will affect different places of livings
* There will be graphical represation of evolution(probably with pyglet)
